# NeuralNetworks-TP2-2025

This repository contains the implementation of feedforward and convolutional neural network models in **PyTorch** for the **TP2 assignment** of **FAMAF – Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física y Computación**.

The project trains and evaluates models on the **Fashion-MNIST image dataset**, exploring the impact of different hyperparameters:

- Optimizers: **SGD** and **Adam**
- Learning rates
- Model complexity (hidden layers and neurons)
- CNN vs. fully connected architectures

All analysis and the written report are in **Spanish**, developed in collaboration with FAMAF students.
